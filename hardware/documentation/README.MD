SwiftMote-Electrochemical (SM-EC) Operation.  
Power: 3.0V->3.3V can be supplied through the B,P, and G pins, refer to the KiCAD (v6.04) schematic and PCB for other options.  
> B: Bluetooth Processor Power  
> P: Potentiostat Power  
> G: Ground  

Programming and Debugging:  
> A Segger J-Link Base Compact was used with a standard 9-pin cable to program the board through connector J1.
> For Software IDE setup, refer to the software repo for this project.  

I/O Maximums and Hardware Operation:  
> Refer to the current ST Microelectronics BlueNRG-LP datasheet (part BLUENRG_355AC) and Analog Devices AD5941 (part AD5941BCPZ) datasheet for details.
